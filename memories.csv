3,"When I almost lost you!","My campus.pk's subscription ended, I was heartbroken. I had lost touch with you, and I thought that would be the end of it. But then, out of nowhere, you texted me on Instagram. Mein hamesha thankful rahonga apka isky liye. buhut bara ihsaan hai apka guriyaaa!. You reached out, and mujhy wohi purani Zainab mil gyi. I remember that feeling of relief when I knew we could still talk. Din raat baatein hony lagien, haal ahwaal , jokes, memes sab share hony lagaa. Bara maaza araha thaa and aadat hony lagi aik dosry ki hmein. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
4,"Zainab meri best friend :)","And hm best friend bn gye yaayyyyyy!!!. We started caring for each other in a way that felt different, more special. We would spend hours talking without worrying about the time. We both knew there was something deeper than just friendship, but neither of us could say it out loud yet. üí´"

So mein nei baat banani shuru krdi hehe. I started talking about how I felt, but I couldn‚Äôt say it directly. Instead, I asked, 'What if you marry someone else? We can't stay friends then, can we?' You replied that you'd never want to lose our friendship either. So, I asked, 'Do you want to be with me forever?' And you said... Yessss!!! My heart was racing, and in that moment, everything felt so right.Mujhy laga jesy k bassss, I am hugging youuu ahhh!!! bas alag he feeling theee.
